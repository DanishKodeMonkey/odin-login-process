# Odin Login

## A login screen using passportJS, mongoose and express

This project is purely for experimental purposes, to play around and figure out how to set up a simple authentication pipeline. The code is kept simple and assembled for reference in terms of required packages and basic setup in later projects and should not be taken as an example of how it should be organised.
